As I Began to Love Myself

# 当我真正开始爱自己

As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth. Today, I know, this is AUTHENTICITY.

当我真正开始爱自己，我才意识到，所有的痛苦和情感的折磨，仅仅是在提醒，我的生活背离了真实的自己。今日，我明白，这叫做「真实」。

As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody as I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me. Today I call it RESPECT.

当我真正开始爱自己，我才懂得，当我将自己的意愿强加于人时，是多么的冒犯无礼，即使那时我知晓时机尚未成熟，那个人也并未做好准备，即便那个人就是我自己。今日我明白这叫做「尊重」。

As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow. Today I call it MATURITY.

当我开始真正爱自己，我不再苛求不一样的人生，我明白任何发生在我身边的事，都是对我成长的邀约。而今，我称之为「成熟」。

As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment, so I could be calm. Today I call it SELF-CONFIDENCE.

当我开始真正爱自己，我才明白在任何情况下，我其实一直处于恰好的时机、恰好的地方，而每件事的发生也都恰如其分。由此，我得以平静。今日，我称其为「自信」。

As I began to love myself I quit stealing my own time, and I stopped designing huge projects for the future. Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do and that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm. Today I call it SIMPLICITY.

当我开始真正爱自己，我不再挥霍自己生命和时间，不再去擘画波澜壮阔的未来。今天的我，只做能为我带来喜悦和幸福的事，做那些我所热爱，且能鼓舞我心的事情，用我特有的方式，按照我自己的节奏。今日我知晓这叫做「简单」。

As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health – food, people, things, situations, and everything that drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism. Today I know it is LOVE OF ONESELF.

当我开始真正爱自己，我开始远离所有不健康的东西，不论是饮食、人物、事情亦或环境，远离拖累我、让我背离了真实自我的一切。从前的我称呼这为“有益健康的利己主义”。今天我知道，这其实是「自爱」。

As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since I was wrong less of the time. Today I discovered that is MODESTY.

As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worry about the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where EVERYTHING is happening. Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it FULFILLMENT.

当我开始真正爱自己，我不再继续沉溺于过去，也不再为明天而忧虑。如今，我只活在这一切正在发生的当下。今天，我活在此时此地，如此日复一日，而我称这为「圆满」。

As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick. But As I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this connection WISDOM OF THE HEART.

当我真正开始爱自己，我明白，我的思虑扰乱了自我，使我变得了无生趣。但当我与本心相连，心灵的力量就成为了我坚实的后盾。今日我称这种连结为「心灵的智慧」。

We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know THAT IS LIFE!

我们无需再害怕生命中的争论、冲突，或是任何出现在与我们自己或与其他人之间的问题。因为即使是星星也会有碰撞在一起的时候，而从它们的撞击中，新的世界将会诞生。今天我知道，这，就是「生命」！
